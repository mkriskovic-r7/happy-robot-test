      <description>If you have multiple assets in your environment, it can be tedious and time consuming to deploy an agent on each one. To save time, the Insight agent can be pushed out to assets using standard patch management software. To do so, proceed through perform steps 1 and 2 in Installing the Insight Agent. The unzipped folder can then be pushed out to assets, and you can then run a silent install of the agent, using the normal Microsoft commands for an MSI file: msiexec /i agentinstaller-x86_x64.</description>

      <description>Installing the Insight Agent allows McAfee ePO users to deploy and manage the Insight Agent via McAfee ePO software management.
This process assumes that the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator is already configured to monitor the Windows systems in your environment, and these target systems have the McAfee Agent installed.
To begin, download the following: * the Rapid7 ePO extension (http://download2.rapid7.com/download/NeXpose-v4/epo-extension/Rapid7Nexpose.zip) * the Rapid7 Manager plugin (http://download2.rapid7.com/download/NeXpose-v4/epo-extension/R7AgentDeployment_0409.zip) * the InsightAgent installer from the “Download agent” page in your application.</description>

      <description>The Insight Agent collects system information from your assets and sends it back to the Rapid7 Insight Platform to be analyzed. Each time an agent provides a status update to the Rapid7 Insight Platform, any of the Insight Products you’ve licensed (InsightVM, InsightIDR, or InsightOps) will respond with any data collection tasks needed for inspection. They communicate with the Insight Platform directly or via the Rapid7 Collector by two-way SSL, secured by TLS v1.</description>

      <title>The Insight Agent Communication with the Insight Platform</title>

      <description>Insight agents will always try to communicate with the Insight platform through a Collector. Agents automatically discover all Collectors in a particular environment and select the Collector that is most efficient. If no Collectors are available, or the path through a Collector is deemed inefficient, then the agent will contact the Insight platform directly.</description>
