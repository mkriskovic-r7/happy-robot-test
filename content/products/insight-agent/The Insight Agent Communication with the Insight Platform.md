title: "The Insight Agent Communication with the Insight Platform"
excerpt: ""
---
Insight agents will always try to communicate with the Insight platform through a Collector. Agents automatically discover all Collectors in a particular environment and select the Collector that is most efficient. If no Collectors are available, or the path through a Collector is deemed inefficient, then the agent will contact the Insight platform directly.
